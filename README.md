My final year Computer Science project.

It was built using Java and SQL.

It was built using an agile SCRUM based methodology starting with a product backlog. Unit testing was used throughout to ensure robustness.

Its interface is a mixture of graphical and commandline based.

It allows the user to create and modify a staff roster: something stores information about current employees.
It then allows the user to create and modify a timetable. The user can draw on the employee roster and slot employees into shifts on a gastropub timetable.
